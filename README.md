# EASE
This is the replication package for our work accepted by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology.

# CCN_WD
This directory contains the CCN_WDs that we built for all the subject systems used in our experiments. There are three versions of CCN_WDs according to different weighting mechanisms (i.e., OWM, DWM, and EWM). Note that a detailed data set will be available after our work's acceptance. Interested readers can email us (Email: wfpan@zjgsu.edu.cn) to get the whole data set in advance. Please use your institutional email address.

# COC
This directory contains the COC values. Our results reported in RQ1 to RQ3 are computed using the CCN_WDs and COC values. Interested readers can use these values and our source code to replicate our experiments.

# GoldSet
This directory contains the true key classes in the subject systems.

# code
This directory will contain the source code that we used to perform all the experiments after our work's acceptance. Now it is null. Interested readers can email us (Email: wfpan@zjgsu.edu.cn) to get the whole data set in advance. Please use your institutional email address.

# RQ1, RQ2, RQ3, and RQ5
These directories contain the results that we used to answer the RQs.

# stat
This directory contains some statistics results referenced in the main context.
